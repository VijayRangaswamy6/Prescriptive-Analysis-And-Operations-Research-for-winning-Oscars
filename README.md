# 🏆 Winning the Oscars: The Role of Prescriptive Analytics & Operations Research

A case study on how data, analytics, and optimization turned an underdog into an Oscar-winning powerhouse.

## 🎬 Overview

This project explores the **Academy Awards** (Oscars) from a strategic and analytical perspective. Focusing on the Best Picture race, it shows how **Prescriptive Analytics** and **Operations Research (OR)** were leveraged by A24 Studios to transform *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (EEAAO) from an unlikely indie film into a **7-time Oscar winner** — including Best Picture.

- Example: Targeting DGA (Directors Guild) voters due to their 80% Oscar prediction accuracy.

### 🧮 Operations Research (OR)
- Applied to **budget allocation and decision-making**.
- Optimized resource use across:
  - Screenings
  - Trade ads
  - Social media
  - Guild outreach
